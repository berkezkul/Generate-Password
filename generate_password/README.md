The working logic of the function is as follows:

First, the variables letters, digits, and special are defined, which represent different types of characters. Next, the characters variable is initialized with letters, which by default contains only letters. If the user specifies that he wants to use numbers, digits are added to the characters variable, and special is added to the characters variable if he specifies that he wants to use special characters.
   Password variable is used to hold the generated random password.
With meets_criteria we will check if the password meets certain criteria. Initially, we set it to False. The has_number and has_special variables are used to check whether the password contains numbers and special characters. Initially, we will set both to False.
  In a loop, at each step, we will assign a random character from characters to the variable new_char and add it to the variable password.
  If new_char contains a number, has_number is set to True, if new_char contains a special character, has_special is set to True. Then meets_criteria is set to True.
  If the user wanted to use numbers, the variable meets_criteria should be the same as has_number; If the user wanted to use special characters, the variable meets_criteria must be the same as has_special.
 The loop continues as long as meets_criteria = False or the length of the password is less than the minimum length. When the loop is complete, the generated password is returned with the return statement and printed on the screen.
  Finally, this code can be used to generate random passwords with certain properties.
